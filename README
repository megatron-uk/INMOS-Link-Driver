INMOS-Link-Driver
=================

Updated INMOS Transputer link driver model for Linux Kernel 3.x.x

This supports the INMOS B004/B008 series of link adaptors to enable the Linux kernel to communicate with the 1980's/1990's INMOS Transputer hardware. 

Should build cleanly with a simple 'make' command, as long as you have Kernel headers and the kbuild package installed.

After install, run a 'mknod /dev/link0 c 24 0' to build the device file.

Build and installs cleaning under Debian 7 (32bit) and Linux kernel 3.2.26, as of November 2014.

Only tested with INMOS B004 compatible hardware so far (Transtech TMB04 motherboard).
See my other projects (INMOS-ispy and the rest) for updated user-level code to utilise the new Link driver module.
